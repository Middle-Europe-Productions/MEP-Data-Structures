#### What is MEP Data Structures?
MEP Data Structures is a open source application developed with the use of MEP library. The software will be able to visualize the functionality of various data structures.
#### Why do I develop MEP Data Structures?
Firstly, to provide the best possible graphical representation of data structures to increase their understanding.
Secondly, to demonstrate the capabilities hidden inside of the MEP library.
Thirdly, to improve my own skills :)
